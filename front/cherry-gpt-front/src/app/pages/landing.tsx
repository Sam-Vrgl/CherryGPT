          My mission is to help you discover which organoid solution is best suited
          to help you with your scientific research.

          To do that I have analysed over 70 companies around the world building
          innovative organoids and micro physiological solutions.
        </p>

          I will ask you some simple questions and then, if relevant, recommend you
          the best tools out there.
