    "Model": "Elveflow OB1 & Organ-on-Chip Pack",
    "Organs/Tissues": "Any organ system (BBB, gut, liver, kidney, lung, tumor, etc.) – hardware-agnostic approach",
    "Physiological/Pathological": "Both. Normal physiology (shear, co-culture) or disease states (inflammation, infection, cancer, etc.)",
    "Cell Source": "All: cell lines, primary cells, iPSC-derived cells, patient tissue, organoids. The user seeds the chosen chip",
    "Multiple Cell Types": "Yes, multi-compartment chips with co-cultures. OB1 precisely handles each side’s flow",
    "Stromal Cells": "Yes (fibroblasts, pericytes, etc.) in 3D or 2D compartments",
    "Tissue-resident Immune": "Yes, included in the tissue or stroma (e.g. microglia in brain, Kupffer cells in liver)",
    "Circulating Immune": "Yes, flow immune cells through an endothelial channel for extravasation or infiltration studies",
    "Crosstalk (Multi-tissue)": "Yes, multi-organ link or multi-chamber chips in series for body-on-chip applications",
    "Air-Liquid Interface": "Supported if the chip design includes an ALI (e.g. lung-on-chip). OB1 can supply vacuum for membrane stretch if needed",
    "Extracellular Matrix": "Yes, from 2D coatings to 3D hydrogels. OB1’s gentle flow preserves ECM structures",
    "3D Scaffold": "Yes (spheroids, organoids, tissue slices). Perfused by OB1-driven flow lines or recirculation loops",
    "Notable Features": "Fast, stable pressure-driven flow. Dynamic flow control (oscillations, pulses). Valves for automated media switching. Low pulsation",
    "Plate/Format (Throughput)": "Chips are slide-based or custom. Typically low–medium throughput (1–4 chips in parallel). Possibly scaled up with multiple OB1 units",
    "Max Culture Duration": "Days–weeks with continuous perfusion, recirculation, stable environment",
    "Readouts - Live Imaging": "Yes, chips made of transparent materials. Stage-compatible. Real-time imaging feasible",
    "Readouts - Supernatant Sampling": "Yes, from outflow or recirculation reservoir. Automated or manual. Low dead volume",
    "Readouts - Cell Retrieval": "Possible with trypsin flush or in situ lysis. Typically smaller yield, in-chip analysis is common",
    "Readouts - Whole Tissue": "Often in situ. Could destructively open or if chip is custom. 3D constructs might be pipetted out if feasible",
    "Readouts - TEER": "No integrated electrodes. Feasible with external instrumentation or custom chip design",
    "Readouts - MEA": "Not built-in. Could integrate if user has an MEA-based chip. OB1 handles fluidic part",
    "Readouts - Integrated Biosensors": "Not by default. They can custom-fabricate chips with sensors. Typically external sampling or optical dyes",
    "Dead Volume": "Minimal. Short microfluidic lines. OB1 pressure control ensures rapid switching, small volumes",
    "Perfused": "Core. Continuous or intermittent flow. Programmable pressure profiles, recirculation loops",
    "Gas Mix Controlled": "Via incubator or external approach. OB1 outside, lines inside. No dedicated O₂/CO₂ module",
    "Real-time Microenvironment Control": "Yes. Dynamic scripts, multi-inlet flow, automated drug pulses, gradient generation",
    "model_availability": "Hardware & service from Elvesys. Chips from partners or custom-made. User supplies cells"

    "Organs/Tissues": "User-defined. Elvesys can design custom chips for any tissue, from single organ to multi-organ MPS",
    "Physiological/Pathological": "Both. They tailor designs for disease states (infection chips, tumor microenvironment) or normal organ function",
    "Cell Source": "User’s choice: lines, primaries, iPSC, organoids. Elvesys can incorporate desired geometry for each cell type",
    "Multiple Cell Types": "Yes, multi-compartment or layered designs to accommodate co-cultures, immune compartments, etc.",
    "Stromal Cells": "Yes, can embed fibroblasts or pericytes in 3D matrix compartments if needed",
    "Tissue-resident Immune": "Yes, chip can have compartments for resident immune cells. E.g. microglia in neural chip",
    "Circulating Immune": "Yes, design a vascular channel for perfusing immune cells. Precisely controlled by OB1",
    "Crosstalk (Multi-tissue)": "Yes, fully customizable. They can link multiple organ compartments in one chip for body-on-chip",
    "Air-Liquid Interface": "Possible if user requests a design with open or semipermeable compartments for lung/skin ALI",
    "Extracellular Matrix": "Yes, can incorporate membranes, 3D gels, porous scaffolds. Elvesys microfabrication can embed or allow user to add ECM",
    "3D Scaffold": "Yes, custom chamber sizes and shapes for organoids or tissue slices. Perfusable networks",
    "Notable Features": "End-to-end solution: Elvesys engineers a chip specifically for the user’s organ model, integrates with OB1 flow",
    "Plate/Format (Throughput)": "Customizable. Could be a single large chamber or multi-unit array. Typically low–medium throughput. Possibly scaled up",
    "Max Culture Duration": "Days–weeks. They can incorporate recirculation or large reservoirs for long-term culture",
    "Readouts - Live Imaging": "Yes, typically designed for optical transparency. Could also design optical windows or sensor spots if needed",
