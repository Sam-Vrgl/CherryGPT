    "Company": "Cellix",
    "Model": "Microvascular Endothelium-on-Chip",
    "Organs/Tissues": "Vascular endothelium (small blood vessel mimic)",
    "Physiological/Pathological": "Both – normal endothelium under flow or diseased states (thrombosis, inflammation)",
    "Cell Source": "Primary human endothelial cells (e.g. HUVEC) or microvascular endothelial lines",
    "Multiple Cell Types": "Often single endothelium + transient blood cells in flow; can add fibroblasts or pericytes in advanced setups",
    "Stromal Cells": "No by default; user can co-culture stromal cells if chip design allows",
    "Tissue-resident Immune": "No; some resident immune cells in endothelium are minimal. Typically rely on added immune cells in flow",
    "Circulating Immune": "Yes (flowing leukocytes, platelets, etc. for adhesion assays)",
    "Crosstalk (Multi-tissue)": "Not in a single chip, can link to other chips if user arranges",
    "Air-Liquid Interface": "No (fully fluid-filled microchannels)",
    "Extracellular Matrix": "Yes (coating on channel surface, e.g. collagen/fibronectin)",
    "3D Scaffold": "No (2D monolayer in a microchannel; channel geometry is 3D)",
    "Notable Features": "Precision shear stress control, real-time imaging of cell adhesion/rolling/thrombosis under flow",
    "Plate/Format (Throughput)": "Biochips with ~8 parallel channels; moderate throughput. Multiple chips can run in parallel",
    "Max Culture Duration": "Typically hours–days under flow; can extend up to ~1 week with careful perfusion",
    "Readouts - Live Imaging": "Yes (microscopic observation of rolling, adhesion, fluorescence labeling)",
    "Readouts - Supernatant Sampling": "Yes (effluent from chip can be collected)",
    "Readouts - Cell Retrieval": "Possible via enzymatic detachment or flush-out",
    "Readouts - Whole Tissue": "Yes, fix chip and stain endothelium in situ",
    "Readouts - TEER": "No integrated electrodes; typically use permeability or molecular assays",
    "Readouts - MEA": "No",
    "Readouts - Integrated Biosensors": "No, external flow sensors or imaging used",
    "Dead Volume": "Low (µL-scale channels + some tubing)",
    "Perfused": "Yes, continuous flow with Cellix pump",
    "Gas Mix Controlled": "By incubator only; chips often in enclosed system",
    "Real-time Microenvironment Control": "Flow rate, compound addition on the fly, no built-in automation besides pump programming",
    "model_availability": "Product (user assembles biology on Cellix hardware)"

    "Company": "Cellix",
    "Model": "Barrier/Epithelial Organ-on-Chip (e.g. Gut or Lung Interface)",
    "Organs/Tissues": "Epithelial layer (intestinal, alveolar) + endothelial channel on separate sides of a porous membrane",
    "Physiological/Pathological": "Both – healthy barrier or inflamed/infected states",
    "Cell Source": "Epithelial cells (Caco-2 for gut, A549 for lung, or primary) + endothelial cells below membrane",
    "Multiple Cell Types": "Yes, typically epithelium + endothelium. Stromal/immune optional if chip design permits",
    "Stromal Cells": "Optional (fibroblasts in matrix or separate compartment)",
    "Tissue-resident Immune": "Not by default; can add immune cells (macrophages, etc.) to epithelium or stroma",
    "Circulating Immune": "Yes if introduced into the endothelial (vascular) channel under flow",
    "Crosstalk (Multi-tissue)": "Epithelium–endothelium crosstalk. Could chain chips for multi-organ if user designs it",
    "Air-Liquid Interface": "Yes for lung (ALI on epithelial side); gut usually fluid–fluid but possible variations",
    "Extracellular Matrix": "Yes (coating or hydrogel on membrane). Membrane is often synthetic but ECM-coated",
    "3D Scaffold": "Membrane + optional 3D gel region; partially 3D arrangement of cells on membrane",
    "Notable Features": "Flow in endothelium channel, parallel epithelial chamber (static or also perfused). Allows drug transport, immune cell migration",
    "Plate/Format (Throughput)": "Standalone microfluidic chip (~4 compartments); moderate–low throughput",
    "Max Culture Duration": "~1–2+ weeks possible if cells remain viable; typically up to 7–14 days",
    "Readouts - Live Imaging": "Yes (translucent chip for confocal/fluorescence from top/bottom)",
    "Readouts - Supernatant Sampling": "Yes (apical/basolateral compartments separate sampling)",
    "Readouts - Cell Retrieval": "Possible but more complex (trypsinize each side), can do end-point histology",
    "Readouts - Whole Tissue": "Yes, fix + immunostain cross-sections or do 3D imaging of membrane layers",
    "Readouts - TEER": "Not by default unless user adds electrodes. Permeability/dye leakage typically used",
    "Readouts - MEA": "No",
    "Readouts - Integrated Biosensors": "No, external sampling/imaging",
    "Dead Volume": "Low in microchannels, adjustable by reservoir/tubing",
    "Perfused": "Yes, typically the endothelial channel is under flow; epithelial side can be static or also perfused",
    "Gas Mix Controlled": "Incubator-based, or ALI for lung epithelium. No separate on-chip regulation",
    "Real-time Microenvironment Control": "Flow rate changes, dosing in medium, no mechanical stretch by default",
    "model_availability": "Product (chips + Cellix pump; user configures cell types)"
