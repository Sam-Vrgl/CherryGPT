    "Circulating Immune": "Yes (neutrophils, lymphocytes can be perfused through vascular channels)",
    "Crosstalk (Multi-tissue)": "Yes, can connect multiple chips or multi-chamber chips to study organ-organ interactions",
    "Air-Liquid Interface": "Supported by partner chips (e.g. BE-Transflow), enabling lung/skin ALI cultures",
    "Extracellular Matrix": "Yes (hydrogels, collagen, Matrigel). Flow is gentle, preserving 3D ECM structures",
    "3D Scaffold": "Yes. Spheroids, organoids, or tissue slices can be perfused in partner chips (e.g. 3D Beonchip devices)",
    "Notable Features": "Precise pressure-based flow control. Pulsation-free. Automated media switching. Real-time flow sensors. Long-term stable perfusion",
    "Plate/Format (Throughput)": "Individual chips, typically 1–4 channels per device. Medium throughput by parallelizing multiple chips",
    "Max Culture Duration": "Days to weeks of continuous perfusion. System stable for extended runs",
    "Readouts - Live Imaging": "Yes (chips are transparent). System can be placed on microscope. Battery or modular design for easy imaging",

    "Readouts - Cell Retrieval": "Possible by enzymatic flush. Typically imaging or in situ analysis is done",
    "Readouts - Whole Tissue": "Difficult, depends on chip design. Often in situ histology. Some chips are openable for 3D constructs",
    "Readouts - TEER": "Not integrated, but feasible with external electrodes or partner chip solutions",
    "Readouts - MEA": "No built-in. Could integrate external MEA chip if needed",
