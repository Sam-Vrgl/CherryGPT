    "Model": "Be-Flow (Two Parallel Channels)",
    "Organs/Tissues": "Vascular endothelium, basic 2D or small 3D cultures under flow; can apply to many tissues (e.g. endothelium-lung, endothelium-tumor). Each channel is separate (no shared membrane).",
    "Physiological/Pathological": "Both. Replicates shear flow for normal vascular conditions or disease states (inflammation, cancer metastasis, etc.).",
    "Cell Source": "Any cell lines or primary cells that can adhere in microchannels. Also small organoids or spheroids placed in the channel flow path.",
    "Multiple Cell Types": "Yes (each channel can hold a distinct cell type or condition), but no direct membrane interface. Co-culture possible if seeded in the same channel or bridging material.",
    "Stromal Cells": "Yes, if embedded in a 3D gel or seeded along with primary cells in the channel.",
    "Tissue-resident Immune": "Possible if included in the same channel or 3D matrix.",
    "Circulating Immune": "Yes, can flow immune cells (e.g. T-cells, PBMCs) through one or both channels to observe adhesion/migration.",
    "Crosstalk (Multi-tissue)": "Limited in a single device (two channels remain separate). For multi-tissue interplay, can connect multiple chips externally.",
    "Air-Liquid Interface": "Not standard. Typically fully liquid-filled channels. ALI would require modifications.",
    "Extracellular Matrix": "Yes, can coat channels with ECM proteins or introduce a thin 3D hydrogel. Channels can be partially filled with collagen gel, for instance.",
    "3D Scaffold": "Yes, small scaffolds or spheroids can be placed in channel. Flow gently bathes them. Often used for small 3D tumor or tissue aggregates.",

    "Plate/Format (Throughput)": "Slide-like chip. Typically 2 conditions per chip, multiple chips in parallel for moderate throughput. Not a multi-well plate format.",
    "Max Culture Duration": "Days to weeks under continuous flow, depending on cell viability. Low evaporation & low drug absorption prolong viability.",

    "Readouts - TEER": "Not integrated. Could attempt external electrodes in each channel. More common to do permeability assays.",
    "Readouts - MEA": "No. Not embedded. External MEA or custom integration needed for electrophysiology.",

    "Perfused": "Yes. Core feature. Continuous or intermittent flow via external pumps. Allows shear stress studies.",
    "Gas Mix Controlled": "Typically in standard incubator. COP is gas-impermeable, so rely on pre-equilibrated media or external environment.",
