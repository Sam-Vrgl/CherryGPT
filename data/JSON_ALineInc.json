    "Notable Features": "ALine fully custom builds. Integrates microvalves, on-chip pumps, or sensor layers. Laser-cut laminate or CNC plastic. Solutions are robust, user-specific.",
    "Plate/Format (Throughput)": "Custom. Usually single device for detailed study. Low throughput by default but can replicate multiple units if needed. Possibly adapted to well-plate footprint if requested.",
    "Max Culture Duration": "Days–weeks. By design, can incorporate recirculation, bubble traps, stable environment for long-term viability.",
    "Readouts - Live Imaging": "Yes, typically uses transparent layers or glass windows. ALine ensures microscope compatibility if needed.",

    "Readouts - Cell Retrieval": "Can design openable or flushable compartments. Typically includes protocols for retrieving cells or lysis in situ.",
    "Readouts - Whole Tissue": "If requested, chip can be made openable or use removable inserts. Alternatively, in situ imaging or post-fixation cut-out.",
    "Readouts - TEER": "Yes, if integrated at design stage. ALine can embed electrodes for measuring barrier function or supply ports for external TEER probes.",
    "Readouts - MEA": "Yes, if user needs neuronal/cardiac electrophysiology. ALine can incorporate embedded electrode arrays or align chip with external MEA.",
    "Readouts - Integrated Biosensors": "Core strength. They can add on-chip O2, pH, glucose sensors, optical detection paths, or electrochemical sensors as required.",
    "Dead Volume": "Minimized by careful design. ALine uses short fluidic paths, microvalves to reduce waste and ensure fast response.",
    "Perfused": "Yes, fundamental. Solutions can have on-chip pumps/valves or external connections. Flow profiles are user-defined.",
    "Gas Mix Controlled": "Customizable. Typically rely on sealed environment or media-based oxygenation. ALine can incorporate gas-permeable or impermeable layers as needed.",
    "Real-time Microenvironment Control": "Yes, advanced. On-chip valves/pumps can deliver dynamic stimuli, cyclical flows, automated protocols, feedback loops with sensors.",
    "model_availability": "Service-based. ALine custom designs & fabricates devices for each project. Not a catalog item – user provides design goals."

    "Model": "Custom Multi-Organ or Advanced Integration Solutions",
    "Organs/Tissues": "Multi-organ-on-chip or multi-chamber systems connecting multiple tissues (liver-kidney, gut-liver-brain, etc.).",
    "Physiological/Pathological": "Both. Complex crosstalk modeling – e.g. healthy synergy or pathologies like metastasis or systemic inflammation.",
    "Cell Source": "Any required by user: iPSC-derived organoids for each organ, primary cells for multi-organ synergy, etc. ALine ensures each organ’s compartment is suitably designed.",
    "Multiple Cell Types": "Yes, each organ chamber can host distinct cell populations (hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, endothelium, immune cells).",
    "Stromal Cells": "Yes, each organ module can embed fibroblasts or stroma relevant to that tissue (e.g. hepatic stellate cells, cardiac fibroblasts).",
    "Tissue-resident Immune": "Yes, e.g. microglia in a brain chamber, Kupffer cells in liver chamber. Chambers can be connected by fluidic channels for cross talk.",
    "Circulating Immune": "Yes, the fluidic network can route immune cells from a blood-mimic reservoir through multiple organ compartments sequentially or in parallel.",
    "Crosstalk (Multi-tissue)": "Key feature. Perfusion loops connect multiple organ compartments, simulating body-level interactions. Valve systems can isolate or link tissues at chosen times.",
    "Air-Liquid Interface": "Possible in one or more compartments if needed (e.g. lung alveolus). ALine can incorporate membranes or open wells.",
