    "Company": "Dynamic42",
    "Model": "Immunocompetent Organ-on-Chip (Single/Tissue-Specific)",
    "Organs/Tissues": "Intestine-on-chip, liver-on-chip, lung-on-chip, etc. Each chip can replicate a single organ with integrated immune + endothelial compartments.",
    "Physiological/Pathological": "Both. Normal organ function under perfusion, or disease states (infection, inflammation, tumor microenvironment). E.g. gut infection with Candida, chronic liver inflammation, etc.",
    "Cell Source": "Primarily human primary cells (epithelial, endothelial, stromal) plus immune cells (macrophages, etc.). For tumor models, uses cancer cell lines or patient tumor cells. Optional iPSC cells in some setups.",
    "Multiple Cell Types": "Yes. Typically 3+ (parenchymal cells, endothelium, immune, fibroblasts). E.g. alveolar-lung with alveolar epithelium, microvascular endothelium, resident macrophages.",
    "Stromal Cells": "Yes. Fibroblasts or stellate cells (in liver). They embed in ECM. For tumor chips, cancer-associated fibroblasts.",
    "Tissue-resident Immune": "Yes. Kupffer cells in liver, alveolar macrophages in lung, gut macrophages, etc. Standard approach for immunocompetent models.",
    "Circulating Immune": "Yes. Perfusable vascular channel allows PBMCs, monocytes, T cells to be introduced in flow. Observed infiltration, polarization, etc.",
    "Crosstalk (Multi-tissue)": "Single-organ chip has one tissue. For multi-organ, they link separate compartments or use multi-chamber chips. 2- or 3-organ systems exist.",
    "Air–liquid interface": "Possible for lung or skin chips if they include a flexible membrane with air on apical side, perfused channel basally. They mention mechanical stimulation, so likely yes for lung.",
    "Extracellular Matrix": "Yes, 3D collagen or fibrin gels in the upper chamber. Cells embed or form spheroids inside it. Endothelium lines a separate channel.",
    "3D scaffold": "Core. Tissue cells + ECM in top chamber. Spheroids or organoids can be integrated (like PDAC tumor spheroids). Immune infiltration studied in 3D context.",
    "Notable Features": "Immunocompetent chips: user can add immune cells in flow. Infectious disease & tumor microenvironment models. Low drug absorption polymer material.",
    "Plate/Format (Throughput)": "Slide-format microfluidic chips. Usually 1 organ model per chip. Low–medium throughput (a few chips in parallel). Standard microscope stage fit.",
    "Max Culture Duration": "Days to weeks. E.g. 7–14 days for infection or tumor infiltration. Possibly up to 3–4 weeks if stable. Perfusion supports long viability.",
    "Readouts - Live Imaging": "Yes, transparent chip. Confocal or fluorescence imaging of infection, immune infiltration, tumor interactions in real time.",
    "Readouts - Supernatant Sampling": "Yes, from the perfusate outlet. Measures cytokines, biomarkers, drug metabolism. Immune cell infiltration can be tracked by flows.",
    "Readouts - Cell Retrieval": "Feasible by digesting ECM or flushing compartments. Then flow cytometry or molecular assays for, e.g., macrophage phenotype.",
    "Readouts - Whole Tissue": "In situ immunofluorescence or fix & section. Membrane with 3D matrix can be carefully removed for histology or confocal.",
    "Readouts - TEER": "Possibly. They do barrier function tests (e.g. tracer leakage). Not explicitly mention built-in TEER electrodes, but feasible with external device.",
    "Readouts - MEA": "No integrated electrodes. Typically rely on imaging, functional assays, immune infiltration. Less relevant for these organ types.",
    "Readouts - Integrated Biosensors": "Not standard. Rely on imaging + sampling. Might do custom if needed.",
    "Dead Volume": "Small channel volume plus external tubing. Minimizes reagent waste, ensures effective dose to the tissue.",
    "Perfused": "Yes, continuous flow via external pump. Circulating immune cells, dynamic drug dosing. Vital part of the design.",
    "Gas Mix Controlled": "Incubator environment. No separate channel gas. The polymer is non-gas-permeable but small volumes + flow supply O2.",
    "Real-time Microenvironment Control": "Flow rate, immune cell injection, infection agent addition can be done any time. Potential mechanical strain for lung. Good for dynamic studies.",
    "model_availability": "Commercial B2B. They sell chips & offer CRO services. Focus on custom immunocompetent disease models."

    "Company": "Dynamic42",
    "Model": "Multiorgan Immunocompetent Platform (2-/3-Organ Linked)",
    "Organs/Tissues": "E.g. gut-liver, lung-liver, or 3-organ combos (with vasculature and immune).",
    "Physiological/Pathological": "Systemic crosstalk in infection (sepsis-on-chip), metastasis (tumor-liver-lung), multi-organ toxicity, etc.",
    "Cell Source": "Various primary human cells for each organ. Possibly patient-derived tumor cells for metastatic chip. Perfused immune cells across compartments.",
    "Multiple Cell Types": "Yes, each organ has epithelial/stromal/immune, plus a shared vascular flow or separate channels interlinked. Complex multi-cell co-cultures across compartments.",
    "Stromal Cells": "Yes, organ-specific stroma in each compartment. E.g. hepatic stellate in liver, fibroblasts in lung, etc.",
    "Tissue-resident Immune": "Yes, each organ includes relevant macrophages, DCs, etc. PBMC perfusion for systemic immune. Highly immunocompetent setup.",
    "Circulating Immune": "Yes, the connecting perfusion route allows immune cells from “blood” to reach each organ. Key for multi-organ inflammatory or metastatic processes.",
    "Crosstalk (Multi-tissue)": "Core feature. Organs share perfusion for factor/metabolite exchange. E.g. gut-liver axis for drug metabolism, or tumor-liver-lung metastatic axis.",
    "Air–liquid interface": "Possible if lung or skin included as one compartment. The rest submerged. Each organ module is specialized. They can do partial ALI for the lung side.",
    "Extracellular Matrix": "Yes, each organ chamber has 3D ECM (collagen/fibrin) for that tissue’s cells. They replicate in vivo architecture in each compartment.",
    "3D scaffold": "Yes, for each organ. Spheroids, organoids, or tissue-specific 3D arrangement. Perfusion across or around them.",
    "Notable Features": "Human multi-organ synergy with immune interplay. Infectious disease or metastatic path across different organ chips. Perfused & microfluidic design.",
    "Plate/Format (Throughput)": "Bespoke chips linking 2–3 organ compartments. Lower throughput: ~1–4 multi-organ chips tested in parallel. More advanced than single organ but more complex to run.",
    "Max Culture Duration": "Up to weeks for multi-organ synergy. Enough for chronic toxicity or infection progression. Perfusion keeps cells viable.",
    "Readouts - Live Imaging": "Yes, can see cross-organ events in real time. 3D confocal to watch immune infiltration across compartments. Transparent materials.",
    "Readouts - Supernatant Sampling": "Yes, from each organ’s outlet or a shared outflow. Track cytokines, drug metabolites, etc. across entire system.",
    "Readouts - Cell Retrieval": "Each organ chamber can be dissected or flushed. Analyze immune vs organ cells separately. E.g. do flow cytometry on emigrated monocytes.",
    "Readouts - Whole Tissue": "On-chip fixation or removing membranes. Immunostaining each organ’s 3D matrix. Multi-organ sections possible if physically separated carefully.",
    "Readouts - TEER": "Potentially. If an epithelial barrier is in one compartment. Usually functional barrier assays used. Not explicitly integrated TEER electrodes.",
    "Readouts - MEA": "No. Typically not for multi-organ. Focus is on crosstalk, immune infiltration, imaging, secretome analysis.",
    "Readouts - Integrated Biosensors": "Not standard. Possibly custom. They mainly do sampling/imaging. Larger microfluidic scale than embedded sensors.",
    "Dead Volume": "Small channels, but linking multiple compartments. Minimizes compound waste. Enough volume to allow multi-organ flow.",
    "Perfused": "Yes, essential. Media flows across each organ compartment in sequence or parallel. Immune cells also delivered in flow. Key to multi-organ crosstalk.",
    "Gas Mix Controlled": "Incubator environment. No separate organ-level gas control. Each organ sees the same O2/CO2 from the external environment.",
    "Real-time Microenvironment Control": "Yes. Users can dose drugs, vary flow rates, inject immune cells, pathogens, etc. across the entire system.",
    "model_availability": "Commercial & CRO service. Dynamic42 sets up custom 2-3 organ chips. Good for complex immunological or infection R&D."
