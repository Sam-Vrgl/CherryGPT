    "Company": "Ibidi",
    "Model": "µ-Slide Channel (2D Flow Chambers)",
    "Organs/Tissues": "Broad range: vascular endothelium, epithelial barriers, tumor–endothelial interaction, immune infiltration, etc.",
    "Physiological/Pathological": "Both. Normal shear conditions for vascular physiology or disease states (inflammation, thrombosis, metastasis)",
    "Cell Source": "Any adherent cell line or primary/iPSC-derived cells. Commonly endothelium, tumor cells, fibroblasts, immune cells",
    "Multiple Cell Types": "Yes (co-culture on channel walls or sequential seeding). Can flow immune cells over confluent endothelium",
    "Stromal Cells": "Yes, if used in layered approaches or a 3D matrix (less common in 2D channel, but possible as a thin gel layer)",
    "Tissue-resident Immune": "Possible if seeded with the main cell population (e.g. macrophages in a monolayer). Rare in pure 2D though",
    "Circulating Immune": "Yes, perfusion of leukocytes or other blood cells to observe rolling/adhesion/transmigration",
    "Crosstalk (Multi-tissue)": "Limited in a single channel. Users may chain multiple slides in series or do multi-step experiments",
    "Air-Liquid Interface": "Not standard. Typically fully liquid-filled channels. ALI usage would require custom arrangement",
    "Extracellular Matrix": "Yes, surface coatings (collagen, fibronectin). 2D environment, typically not thick 3D ECM",
    "3D Scaffold": "Not in the standard 2D channel. Typically 2D monolayers. Some advanced usage might embed thin gels",
    "Notable Features": "Well-established slides for cell culture under flow. Optimal for real-time microscopy of 2D cell layers",
    "Plate/Format (Throughput)": "Slide format (1–6 parallel channels). Low–medium throughput. Each channel = 1 condition",
    "Max Culture Duration": "Days to ~2 weeks under continuous flow, depending on cell viability",
    "Readouts - Live Imaging": "Yes, made for high-quality microscopy (phase, fluorescence, confocal)",
    "Readouts - Supernatant Sampling": "Yes, from outlet. Minimal volume in channel. Easy to collect for assays",
    "Readouts - Cell Retrieval": "Possible via trypsin flush. Usually used for in situ imaging/staining",
    "Readouts - Whole Tissue": "In situ. Slide not designed to be opened. Typically image-based endpoints",
    "Readouts - TEER": "No integrated electrodes. Could possibly measure if user modifies. Not typical",
    "Readouts - MEA": "No built-in. Usually not combined with electrophysiology in standard slides",
    "Readouts - Integrated Biosensors": "No. Just optical imaging. External or off-chip sensors for biochemical readouts",
    "Dead Volume": "Low (~30 µL in each channel). Minimizes reagent use, rapid solution exchange",
    "Perfused": "Yes, with Ibidi Pump or other pumps. Stable or pulsed flow for shear stress studies",
    "Gas Mix Controlled": "In an incubator or with Ibidi stage incubator. Slide is closed, so rely on medium pre-equilibration",
    "Real-time Microenvironment Control": "Flow rate easily changed mid-experiment. Media/drug switching possible. No built-in automation",
    "model_availability": "Commercial product. Purchase µ-Slides & optional Ibidi Pump. User seeds and designs the biology"

    "Company": "Ibidi",
    "Model": "µ-Slide 3D Perfusion / Spheroid",
    "Organs/Tissues": "3D cell models: tumor spheroids, organoids (heart, kidney, etc.), tissues in hydrogel",
    "Physiological/Pathological": "Both. Allows normal 3D tissue architecture or disease states (cancer, fibrotic, infected organoids)",
    "Cell Source": "Spheroids from cell lines or patient-derived, iPSC organoids, ex vivo tissue fragments in a 3D matrix",
    "Multiple Cell Types": "Yes (co-culture in 3D). E.g. tumor cells + fibroblasts + immune cells in a single spheroid",
    "Stromal Cells": "Yes, embedded with parenchymal cells in the gel or forming a 3D stromal environment",
    "Tissue-resident Immune": "Yes, can incorporate macrophages or other immune subsets into the organoid or gel",
    "Circulating Immune": "Yes, if user connects a perfusion channel around the 3D construct and introduces immune cells",
    "Crosstalk (Multi-tissue)": "Each slide typically houses one 3D tissue or spheroid set. Multi-organ crosstalk would require linking multiple slides",
    "Air-Liquid Interface": "No standard ALI. These slides are closed channels for 3D fluidic perfusion",
    "Extracellular Matrix": "Yes, fill the chamber with collagen, Matrigel, or fibrin to embed cells",
    "3D Scaffold": "Core feature. The user places spheroids or seeds cells in a 3D gel inside the perfusion chamber",
    "Notable Features": "Built for live imaging of 3D constructs under flow. Maintains nutrient gradients, fosters real 3D cell behavior",
    "Plate/Format (Throughput)": "Slide-based. Typically 1–2 or a few 3D constructs per slide. Low–medium throughput. Parallel slides for multiple conditions",
    "Max Culture Duration": "Days–weeks. Continuous flow feeding organoids or spheroids. Extended viability vs. static culture",
    "Readouts - Live Imaging": "Yes, high-quality optical transparency for confocal or widefield. Real-time observation of 3D structures",
    "Readouts - Supernatant Sampling": "Yes, from outlet line. Good for secretome analysis",
    "Readouts - Cell Retrieval": "Possibly remove spheroids by pipette if not strongly embedded, or do in situ endpoint. Slide not easily opened",
    "Readouts - Whole Tissue": "In situ confocal is typical. For histology, can attempt to recover the gel. Not straightforward",
    "Readouts - TEER": "No integrated electrodes. Typically not for barrier measurement, but 3D tissue function",
    "Readouts - MEA": "No. Spheroid slides lack electrodes. Usually rely on optical readouts",
    "Readouts - Integrated Biosensors": "No built-in chemical sensors. Rely on external sampling or imaging dyes",

    "Perfused": "Yes, with Ibidi Pump or other systems. Provides nutrients & shear around 3D constructs",
    "Gas Mix Controlled": "Incubator-based or stage-top incubator for CO₂. Medium can be pre-equilibrated. No direct O₂ control",
    "Real-time Microenvironment Control": "Flow rate, media composition can be changed mid-culture. Automated or manual pump control",
    "model_availability": "Commercial product from Ibidi. Users embed 3D culture (organoids/spheroids) in the slides"
