    "Readouts - Supernatant Sampling": "Yes, from perfusion outlets for metabolic/secreted markers",
    "Readouts - Cell Retrieval": "Difficult (bonded chip). Usually in-chip analysis or destructive opening. In situ lysis for RNA/protein",
    "Readouts - Whole Tissue": "If membrane is retrieved by opening the chip, partial. Typically do on-chip imaging",
    "Readouts - TEER": "Not integrated. Possible by inserting electrodes or custom design",
    "Readouts - MEA": "No standard. Usually not integrated. Would require custom electrode addition",
    "Readouts - Integrated Biosensors": "No by default. Potential for custom O2 or pH sensors. Some examples in publications",

    "Organs/Tissues": "Any 3D tissue, organoid, or scaffold. Model e.g. liver organoid, tumor spheroid, cardiac patch",
    "Physiological/Pathological": "Both. Healthy or diseased 3D tissues. Long-term perfusion or repeated dosing",
    "Cell Source": "User-chosen 3D constructs: iPSC organoids, primary tumor spheroids, decellularized scaffolds, etc.",
    "Multiple Cell Types": "Yes, can embed multi-cell organoids or co-culture. 5 replicate units/chip for parallel tests",
    "Stromal Cells": "Yes, if included in the 3D construct. Chip accommodates fibroblasts, ECM, etc.",

    "Circulating Immune": "Yes, can flow immune cells around 3D tissue for infiltration assays",
    "Crosstalk (Multi-tissue)": "Within one unit, just the single 3D tissue. For multi-organ, link multiple units or multiple chips",
    "Air-Liquid Interface": "Not typical. Usually submerged 3D scaffold. Possibly open top if user modifies seal",
    "Extracellular Matrix": "Yes, user can place scaffolds or hydrogels in the central chamber. ECM essential for 3D organoids",
