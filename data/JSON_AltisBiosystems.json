      "Readouts - MEA": "No (not relevant for gut epithelium)",
      "Readouts - Integrated Biosensors": "No built-in; rely on external assays (TEER device, imaging, etc.)",

      "Company": "Altis Biosystems",
      "Model": "RepliGut® Crypt",
      "Organs/Tissues": "Human intestinal epithelium with stem-cell crypt architecture (long-term renewal)",
      "Physiological/Pathological": "More dynamic crypt-villus axis replication, can model injury/repair, IBD, chronic toxicity",
      "Cell Source": "Primary adult intestinal stem cells from various GI regions (small/large intestine)",
      "Multiple Cell Types": "Multiple epithelial lineages (proliferative crypt cells + differentiated enterocytes/goblet), no external stroma/immune",
      "Stromal Cells": "No, purely epithelial with stem cell zone in crypt-like structure",
      "Tissue-resident Immune": "No",
      "Circulating Immune": "No, but can add inflammatory signals exogenously",
      "Crosstalk (Multi-tissue)": "Single tissue model, can be connected externally if needed",
      "Air–Liquid Interface": "No, typically submerged culture",
      "Extracellular Matrix": "Hydrogel or coated membrane supporting crypt formation",
      "3D Scaffold": "Semi-3D micro-architecture forming crypt pockets, but overall plate-based",
      "Notable Features": "Longer-term viability with ongoing crypt-based proliferation, enabling repeated injury/regeneration studies",
      "Plate/Format (Throughput)": "Similar to Planar, 12- or 96-well format but specialized crypt inserts",
      "Max Culture Duration": "Up to ~2 weeks with crypt maintenance, potentially longer than Planar",
      "Readouts - Live Imaging": "Yes, can see crypt formation, use fluorescence for cell lineage tracking",
