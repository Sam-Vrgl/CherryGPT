    "Company": "Be/ond (Bi/ond)",
    "Model": "inCHIPit™ with comPLATE™ (General Organ-on-Chip Platform)",
    "Organs/Tissues": "Versatile: kidney, liver, gut, skin, brain, tumor tissues, etc. The open-well + microfluidic channel approach suits many organ or tumor models.",
    "Physiological/Pathological": "Both. Normal organ function (vascular perfusion, mechanical cues) or diseased conditions (tumors, inflammation, infection).",
    "Cell Source": "Flexible: iPSC-derived organoids, primary cells, tumor biopsies, standard lines. 3D organoids or ex vivo slices. Endothelial + parenchymal co-culture.",
    "Multiple Cell Types": "Yes, co-culture in open well (3D tissue) plus endothelial or different cell type in perfused channel below or adjacent.",
    "Stromal Cells": "Yes, can embed fibroblasts or mesenchyme with parenchymal cells in 3D. Endothelial lining in microchannel for vascular mimicry.",
    "Tissue-resident Immune": "Yes, can incorporate immune cells in the tissue/3D construct. E.g. macrophages within tumor slice or organoid.",
    "Circulating Immune": "Yes, the perfusable channel can introduce immune cells under flow, enabling infiltration studies.",
    "Crosstalk (Multi-tissue)": "Open well supports organoid or tissue; channel mimics vasculature. For multi-organ link, multiple comPLATE wells can be connected or used in parallel.",
    "Air-Liquid Interface": "Achievable by using single-flow top well open to air (for lung or skin). Bottom channel perfuses medium from below.",
    "Extracellular Matrix": "Yes, 3D hydrogel or scaffold can be placed in open well. The porous membrane & flow below supply nutrients.",
    "3D Scaffold": "Core feature. Organoids or tissue slices set in 3D matrix in the well. Perfusion from below prevents necrosis.",
    "Notable Features": "Open well + microchannel design. Porous membrane. Long-term perfusion. Mechanical & electrical stimulation (with expansions). Low auto-fluorescence. Standard 6-well plate footprint.",
    "Plate/Format (Throughput)": "6-well comPLATE. Each well = 1 microfluidic chip. Up to 6 parallel organ-on-chip cultures. Medium throughput vs. typical single-chip solutions.",
    "Max Culture Duration": "Days–weeks. Reports of 7–14 days for tumor slices, 9+ days for organoids with stable perfusion.",
    "Readouts - Live Imaging": "Yes, transparent bottom window. Compatible with inverted microscopy, confocal, real-time imaging.",
    "Readouts - Supernatant Sampling": "From outflow of lower channel. The open well can also be sampled. Low volume channels => rapid solution changes.",
    "Readouts - Cell Retrieval": "Easier than closed chips: 3D tissue in the well can be pipetted out or lifted. Membrane-based structure can also be removed carefully if desired.",
    "Readouts - Whole Tissue": "Yes, entire organoid or slice can be removed post-experiment for histology. Or do immunostaining in situ.",
    "Readouts - TEER": "No integrated electrodes, but user could attempt external TEER setup. Usually rely on paracellular tracer assays or morphological integrity checks.",
    "Readouts - MEA": "Not standard, though the MUSbit variant includes electrodes for muscle/heart. inCHIPit itself doesn't have built-in MEA.",
    "Readouts - Integrated Biosensors": "Not by default. Possibly future expansions. Typically external sampling or imaging-based measurements. They do offer mechanical/electrical stimulation expansions for muscle.",
    "Dead Volume": "Low. Microchannel volume is minimal, ensuring efficient media usage and quick response to changes.",
    "Perfused": "Yes. Single-flow mode (bottom channel only) or double-flow (both top and bottom). Allows stable nutrient supply for 3D tissues.",
    "Gas Mix Controlled": "Place comPLATE in standard incubator for CO₂. The sealed channel environment uses pre-equilibrated media. ALI or normal submersion is user’s choice.",
    "Real-time Microenvironment Control": "Flow rate, drug dosing, and mechanical stimulation can be changed any time. If muscle or heart model: electrical pacing included in expansions (MUSbit).",
    "model_availability": "Commercial from Bi/ond. The comPLATE and inCHIPit chips are sold for standard organ-on-chip. Users provide biology, can choose single or double-flow lids."

  {
    "Company": "Be/ond (Bi/ond)",
    "Model": "MUSbit™ (Cardiac/Skeletal Muscle-on-Chip)",
    "Organs/Tissues": "3D engineered muscle tissue (cardiac or skeletal), including hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes for heart-on-chip or muscle fiber cultures.",
    "Physiological/Pathological": "Both. Normal contractile function (beating heart tissue) or disease states (cardiomyopathies, muscular dystrophy).",
    "Cell Source": "Primarily cardiomyocytes (iPSC or primary) or skeletal myocytes. Co-culture with fibroblasts or supportive cells for mature muscle. Possibly patient-derived lines for disease modeling.",
    "Multiple Cell Types": "Yes, fibroblasts or vascular cells can be integrated. The system focuses on muscle fibers but can include supporting stroma.",
    "Stromal Cells": "Yes, fibroblasts, mesenchymal cells in the muscle scaffold to promote physiological structure. Endothelial networks also possible.",
    "Tissue-resident Immune": "Less common in muscle, but feasible if user wants an inflammatory scenario (myositis). System is designed mainly for myocytes & stroma.",
    "Circulating Immune": "Possible if the user sets up a perfusable channel around the muscle fiber zone for infiltration. Not the main standard usage.",
    "Crosstalk (Multi-tissue)": "In principle, can combine MUSbit with another organ chip for multi-organ circuits. MUSbit focuses on muscle contraction readouts.",
    "Air-Liquid Interface": "Not typically relevant for muscle. The chip is fully perfused or partly sealed. No ALI needed for muscle tissue.",
    "Extracellular Matrix": "Yes, muscle cells embed in a 3D gel (collagen, fibrin) anchored to pillars or flexible posts to form aligned fibers.",
    "3D Scaffold": "Core concept: 3D muscle tissue with anchor points. The chip fosters alignment, supports conduction of contraction signals.",
    "Notable Features": "Electrical & mechanical stimulation for muscle training. Force measurement via post deflection. Perfect for testing inotropes or muscle diseases in vitro.",
    "Plate/Format (Throughput)": "Similar to inCHIPit approach, typically 1 muscle construct per chip. Could run multiple in parallel in a comPLATE-like setup. Low–medium throughput.",
    "Max Culture Duration": "Up to weeks while the muscle matures and maintains function under repeated contractions. Perfusion prevents necrosis.",
    "Readouts - Live Imaging": "Yes, track fiber alignment and contractile motion via optical methods (confocal or video).",
    "Readouts - Supernatant Sampling": "Yes, perfusate can be collected. For troponin release or metabolic markers, etc.",
    "Readouts - Cell Retrieval": "Potentially enzymatic release from the 3D gel. Usually endpoint includes on-chip imaging or destructive sampling of tissue.",
    "Readouts - Whole Tissue": "In situ imaging is standard. Tissue can be removed if the design allows. Typically fix and stain on chip, measure force directly on pillars.",
    "Readouts - TEER": "Not relevant for muscle. No epithelial barrier. Passive electrical conduction is measured differently (MEA approach).",
    "Readouts - MEA": "Yes, partial. MUSbit has built-in electrodes for electrical pacing/stimulation, might measure field potentials. Fully integrated MEA might be partial or planned.",
    "Readouts - Integrated Biosensors": "Force sensing is integrated via micro-post deflection. Additional sensors (pH, O2) not standard but feasible externally.",
    "Dead Volume": "Low in microchannels. Perfusion specifically around muscle fiber zone to supply nutrients, remove waste.",
    "Perfused": "Yes, continuous flow for nutrient supply. Electrical stimulation for pacing. Possibly cyclical mechanical tension if desired.",
    "Gas Mix Controlled": "Incubator environment or pre-equilibrated media. No specialized O2 exchange. Enough for muscle to survive if flow is correct.",
    "Real-time Microenvironment Control": "Yes. One can vary pacing frequency, apply drugs, or modify flow. Watch contractile changes in real time.",
    "model_availability": "Commercial from Bi/ond for muscle tissue research. iPSC or primary muscle cells used. Sold as an advanced add-on to comPLATE or standalone."
